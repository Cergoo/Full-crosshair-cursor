# Full-crosshair-cursor
It's just simple helper web browser extension.
It draws full window crosshair cursor. I wrote this to make it easier to analyze .png charts that I open in a web browser.
It doesn't have any settings. Just enable this extension when you need the crosshair to work and disable it when you don't need it.
